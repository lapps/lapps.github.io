# Discriminators

Discriminators are the set of URI used by LAPPS Grid services and should really be referred to as *The LAPPS URI Inventory*. URI in the LAPPS inventory fall into three general categories:

1. Media types. For example the URI for LIF documents.
1. Metadata. Information about licensing, allowable uses, or actions a service should perform.
1. Vocabulary types.  Annotation types added by services that have additional semantics associated with them.

For historical reasons the Discriminator DSL language includes keywords and provisions for concepts that no longer apply.  In particular, *parents*, *offset*, and *bank* will go away.
