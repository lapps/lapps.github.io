Some random developer notes on the vocabulary and discriminators.

For notes on how to change the vocabulary see the [page in the installation section](http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/installation/discriminators.html).

If you want to create test versions and in the process need to create the [vocabulary](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/vocabulary-dsl) or [discriminator](and https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/discriminator-dsl) DSLs, then your Maven installation may need access to the snapshots that may be used for those DSLs. There is a [settings file](https://downloads.lappsgrid.org/scripts/settings.xml) on the lappsgrid.org site with repository definitions that should be added to your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.
