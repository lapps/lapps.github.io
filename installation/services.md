### Creating and adding services

How to create services - wrapping, discriminators, LIF, WSEV, deploying, registering


#### Wrapping:

- [Wrapping services](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples) - README.md file in org.lappsgrid.examples repository


#### LIF and WSEV:

- output of wrapped components should follow LIF specifications and use elements from WSEV
- [LIF specifications](interchange/index.html)
- [LIF JSON-schema](schema/lif-schema.json)
- [WSEV at http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/)
- [WSEV discussion](http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/vocabulary/current_issues.html)
- [WSEV issues](https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages/issues)

#### Vocabulary and Discriminators:

- everything in vocab is in discriminators but not vice versa (vocab âŠ‚ discriminator)
- there is a vocab dsl and a discriminators dsl (both configuration files for transformations)
  1. [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/vocabulary-dsl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/vocabulary-dsl)
  2. [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl)
- the input to 1 is `lapps.vocab` in [https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages](https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages) (there are also template files and other onput files for the mapping in there), it creates 
  1. vocab.lappsgrid.org `html`, 
  1. [org.lappsgrid.vocabulary](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.vocabulary) (which is like the discriminator package and describes attribute names etcetera defined in the vocab), 
  1. and a Groovy config DSL file with same content
- the input to 2 is the config DSL file above and a file named [discriminators.config](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl/blob/master/src/main/resources/discriminators.config) in the org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl repository, the output is [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators) page and parts of the java package in [https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.discriminator](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.discriminator)

**check whether this all still works**

Discriminators are used in the produces and requires sections of a tool wrapper's metadata. It is up to the tool wrapper to check whether input has what it needs (searching the contains section of the metadata section of a view. THere is also a discriminator handed in with the Data structure, which has a discriminator and a payload section. The dicriminator there is one of the dozen or so media discriminators in [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators) (for example, the discriminator gate	which refers to http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml#gate).


#### Deploying:

Explained in the wrapping manual in [github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples), which was listed above. 

After deploying a war file to tomcat the new war will be deployed automatically, but if you changed Java versions while running a tomcat server then you do need to restart Tomcat.


#### Registering:

Use the lddl-scripts in [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts)

Register using LDDL to update the service on the service manager on vassar or brandeis servers. Using Brandeis.lddl for Brandeis in lddl-scripts. Brandeis.lddl refers to lddl scripts in the brandeis subdirectory, thise would typically be changed or scripts would be added there for deploying new tools. There is a fork of this on brandeis-nlp, will probably rplace that by using a brandeis branch on lappsgrid-incubator.

We are still assuming old version of the service manager

The lddl-scripts/Update.lddl script takes another script from brandeis or vassar and installs/updates just that module

**check whether this works with new service manager**

- there is a cleanup script that cleans out the database but with the new database there may be new fields that ar enot cleaned up.
