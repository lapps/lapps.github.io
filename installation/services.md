Adding a service to the LAPPS Grid involves various things:

1. Wrapping the service as a Web Application. In essence this is about creating a WAR file, but it also requires the developer to know about Lappsgrid Exchange Datastructures (LEDS), the LAPPS Interchange Format (LIF), the Web Sevices Exchange Vocabulary (WSEV), and the use of discriminators.
2. Deploying the service.
3. Registering the service with the Service Manager.


### 1. Wrapping a Service

There are extensive notes on how to wrap a service at [https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples). Those notes are set up as a series of steps and each time you click a next step then the code associated with that step will be available in the repository. The result of all those steps can be obtained as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples
$ git checkout step5
$ mvn clean package
```

We are assuming that you use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> for building your project. Given the project object model file (POM file) in the repository, the `mvn clean package` command will create a war file named `target/YOUR_ARTIFACT_NAME.war`, if you had followed the instruction you would have changed that name at some point.

<!--
Note that the code in org.lappsgrid.examples was based on https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.example.java.whitespacetokenizer, the latter is now obsolete and will be removed.

The POM file has one dependency:

<dependency>
     <groupId>org.lappsgrid</groupId>
     <artifactId>all</artifactId>
     <version>2.3.1</version>

This refers to https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.all, which has a POM file that refers to all other default dependencies.
-->

You can actually do the same (without the checkout step) with any of the repositories that implement a wrapped service, including:

- [https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.lapps.stanford](https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.lapps.stanford)
- [https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.lapps.gate](https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.lapps.gate)
- [https://github.com/brandeis-nlp/edu.brandeis.cs.stanfordnlp-web-service](https://github.com/brandeis-nlp/edu.brandeis.cs.stanfordnlp-web-service)
- [https://github.com/brandeis-nlp/edu.brandeis.cs.opennlp-web-service](https://github.com/brandeis-nlp/edu.brandeis.cs.opennlp-web-service)

All these repositories will be moved to the [https://github.com/lappsgrid-services](https://github.com/lappsgrid-services) organization.

In the rest of this section we give a bit of high-level background on what services consume and create.


##### Lappsgrid Exchange Datastructures (LEDS)

All strings passed to and from LAPPS services are JSON strings containing LEDS, which are implemented as Data objects in [org.lappsgrid.serialization.Data](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.serialization/blob/develop/src/main/groovy/org/lappsgrid/serialization/Data.groovy). Each LEDS consists of a discriminator, a dictionary of parameters and a payload. We will ignore the parameters here for now since most services do not use them and focus on the discriminator and the payload. The discriminator is used to determine how the contents of the payload should be interpreted (see below for more about discriminators). In general, a discriminator is a URI from the LAPPS Web Service URI Inventory at [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators.html](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators.html). The dicriminator used in a LEDS is a special kind of discriminator since it is restricted to be one of a dozen or so media discriminators in the URI inventory. For example, the `gate` discriminator refers to [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml#gate](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml#gate) and instructs the service that the payload is to be interpreted as a GATE data structure.

Here is a simple example of a LEDS:

```json
{ 
  "discriminator": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/text",
  "payload": "Comments should be received no later than 3:00 PM EST on Sunday, August 26.\n"
}
```

In this case the discriminator instructs the service that the payload is plain text.


##### LAPPS Interchange Format (LIF) and Web Sevices Exchange Vocabulary (WSEV)

- output of wrapped components should follow LIF specifications and use elements from WSEV
- [LIF specifications](interchange/index.html)
- [LIF JSON-schema](schema/lif-schema.json)
- [WSEV at http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/)
- [WSEV discussion](http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/vocabulary/current_issues.html)
- [WSEV issues](https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages/issues)

The WSEV, also know as the LAPPS Vocabulary or simply the Vocabulary, ...


##### Discriminators and the LAPPS Vocabulary

- everything in vocab is in discriminators but not vice versa (vocab âŠ‚ discriminator)
- there is a vocab dsl and a discriminators dsl (both configuration files for transformations)
  1. [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/vocabulary-dsl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/vocabulary-dsl)
  2. [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl)
- the input to 1 is `lapps.vocab` in [https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages](https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages) (there are also template files and other onput files for the mapping in there), it creates 
  1. vocab.lappsgrid.org `html`, 
  1. [org.lappsgrid.vocabulary](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.vocabulary) (which is like the discriminator package and describes attribute names etcetera defined in the vocab), 
  1. and a Groovy config DSL file with same content
- the input to 2 is the config DSL file above and a file named [discriminators.config](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl/blob/master/src/main/resources/discriminators.config) in the org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl repository, the output is [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators) page and parts of the java package in [https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.discriminator](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.discriminator)

**check whether this all still works**

Discriminators are used in the produces and requires sections of a tool wrapper's metadata. It is up to the tool wrapper to check whether input has what it needs (searching the contains section of the metadata section of a view. THere is also a discriminator handed in with the Data structure, which has a discriminator and a payload section. The dicriminator there is one of the dozen or so media discriminators in [http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators](http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/discriminators) (for example, the discriminator gate	which refers to http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml#gate).


### 2. Deploying a Service

Simply put the war file in the `webapps` directory under a Tomcat server set up for the service. This is also explained in the wrapping manual in [github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples](https://github.com/lapps/org.lappsgrid.examples) under step 4 near the end. After deploying a war file to Tomcat the new war will be deployed automatically (however, if you changed Java versions while running a tomcat server then you do need to restart Tomcat).


### 3. Registering a Service

You register services with the Service Manager by using LDDL scripts like the ones at [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts). LDDL is the LAPPS Database Description Language, which is a Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language) that can be used to initialize a LAPPS Grid database. See [http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/lddl/] (http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/lddl/) for more information on LDDL.

To run LDDL scripts you need the LDDL jar that you can create from the code at [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl
$ cd org.anc.lapps.lddl/
$ make jar
$ cp target/lddl-1.3.4.jar ~/bin
```

You can now take the main LDDL script at `src/main/resources` and edit it by replacing `__VERSION__` by the current version number. Then put the `lddl` script somewhere and make sure that location is on the path.

```
$ sed 's/__VERSION__/1.3.4/g' src/main/resources/lddl > lddl
$ chmod +x lddl
$ mv lddl ~/bin
$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

[https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl)

Use the lddl-scripts in [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts)

Register using LDDL to update the service on the service manager on vassar or brandeis servers. Using Brandeis.lddl for Brandeis in lddl-scripts. Brandeis.lddl refers to lddl scripts in the brandeis subdirectory, thise would typically be changed or scripts would be added there for deploying new tools. There is a fork of this on brandeis-nlp, will probably rplace that by using a brandeis branch on lappsgrid-incubator.

We are still assuming old version of the service manager

The lddl-scripts/Update.lddl script takes another script from brandeis or vassar and installs/updates just that module

**check whether this works with new service manager**

- there is a cleanup script that cleans out the database but with the new database there may be new fields that ar enot cleaned up.
