## {{ page.title }}


Documentation is in [http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/technical/galaxy.html](http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/technical/galaxy.html).

This uses scripts in [installation and setup scripts](http://downloads.lappsgrid.org/scripts/). Which has a bunch of ubuntu style setup scripts.

There are two repos with Galaxy code:
  - We have a fork [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/Galaxy](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/Galaxy) of [https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) with some lapps specific modifications
  - The LAPPS Grid modifications to core Galaxy are in the [GalaxyMods](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/GalaxyMods) repository

In addition, there are Galaxy webhooks for extending the Galaxy client without changing the Galaxy code base at [https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/webhooks.html](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/webhooks.html)
