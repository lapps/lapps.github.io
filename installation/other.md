No documentation available. We first need to get everything on the latest service manager.


### Creating a lappsgrid with galaxy-appliances

- A system for configuring a network of LAPPS Grid Docker images
- [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/galaxy-appliance](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/galaxy-appliance)


### Using ansible

Like bash scripts but more portable.

[https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lapps-container](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lapps-container)

This is an in-progress pipe dream.


### Conda and the Galaxy toolshed

We are not using those excapt tht we have one tool on the toolshed to prove we can do it.


### Using Jupyter

- [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel)
- [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-lsd-kernel](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-lsd-kernel)
  

### LDDL and LSD

Both are Groovy DSLs.

LSD - Lapps Services DSL, a DSL for invoking LAPPS web services (possibly pipelined).

The code base for LSD is at [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.dsl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.dsl)

LDDL - LAPPS Database Definition Language

Configuration scripts for the LAPPS grid at [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/org.anc.lapps.lddl)

LDDL scripts at [https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/lddl-scripts)

[http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/](http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/) has some notes on LDDL and LSD

Description of LDDL: [http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/lddl/](http://www.lappsgrid.org/software/lddl/)

There is an outdated wiki at [https://github.com/ksuderman/lsd-scripts/wiki](https://github.com/ksuderman/lsd-scripts/wiki)
