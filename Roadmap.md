<div class="note">
<span style="color:red">Note</span> These tasks should be prioritized.
</div>

* Wrap HeidelTime annotator for adding Timex3 tags to text.<br/>
[https://code.google.com/p/heideltime/](https://code.google.com/p/heideltime/)
* Wrap some UIMA Services
* Licensing
	* common authentication/authorization service
	* protect web services
* Harmonize vocab pages with the LIF schema
* Outstanding Issues
	* ID values in views.  Currently ID values are <span class="red">not</span> unique
	in a JSON document. E.g. a token will have the same ID in every view it appears in. How 
	do we say, *"I want token x from view y."*
