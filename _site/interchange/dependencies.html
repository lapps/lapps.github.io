<h1>Dependency Structure in LIF</h1>

<p>Last updated: October 29<sup>th</sup>, 2015</p>


<p>We use two annotation types from the vocabulary, DependencyStructure and Dependency:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/DependencyStructure.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/DependencyStructure.html</a>
<li><a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Dependency.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Dependency.html</a>)
</ul>

<p>The DependencyStructure object contains a list of dependencies, typically for
a sentence. It introduces a feature named dependencies which contains a list of
identifiers referring to annotations of @type Dependency in the same view. A
Dependency has a label reflecting the dependency name and in its feature
dictionary it has references to the governor and dependent. Note that the ROOT
node has no governor.</p>

<!--
<p>Some notes and open issues on the above (some are similar to the notes for
the <a href="phrase_structure-v1.html">phrase structure</a> specifications):</p>

<ol class="spacy">

<li>Similar to the coreference structure, should the children be local
identifiers? In the example above, two of the dependencies refer to tokens in
another view. For coreference, we stipulated that only Markable objects can
refer to objects in other views. Do we have a same stipulation here? Using
Markable objects seems wrong here.

<li>In addition to the DependencyStructure object this view could also have Token
objects in it and the governor and dependent features would refer to identifiers
in the same view.

<li>The "type" feature for the DependencyStructure node is copied from the
"type" attribute of the "dependencies" tag generated by the Stanford dependency
parser.

<li>Stanford uses "ROOT" as the value for "governor" in the root dependency,
which does not fit our model where we use identifiers (Stanford actually prints
the token string as governors and dependents). We use null here to indicate
there is no governor.
