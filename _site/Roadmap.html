<div class="note">
<span class="red">Note</span> These tasks should be prioritized and assigned to
specific organizations/people.
</div>

<p>There are several major goals to achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated LAPPS demo for the Kyoto workshop</li>
  <li>LAPPS version usable for CMU course</li>
  <li>LAPPS version usable for Brandeis course</li>
  <li>Implement licensing model</li>
  <li>Request changes to the service grid</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="updated-lapps-demo-for-the-kyoto-workshop">Updated LAPPS demo for the Kyoto workshop.</h3>

<p>This would be due a few days before Nancy leaves for the workshop. The workshow is January 22-23.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/heideltime/">https://code.google.com/p/heideltime/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Test and update existing services to conform to LIF and vocab. <span class="green">Vassar/Brandeis</span></li>

objects. <span class="green">Marc</span></li>
  <li>Wrap a service that consumes the output of coref, phrase structure and
dependency structure services <span class="green">Brandeis</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This is partially to test the LIF of newly wrapped annotation types</li>
      <li>One option is to simply provide a simplistic printout of the LIF conent</li>
      <li>This could be a version of the current <a href="http://eldrad.cs-i.brandeis.edu:8484/jld/visualization.html">BRAT
    visualization</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updates to Composer <span class="green">CMU</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lapps-version-usable-for-cmu-miis-seminar-course">LAPPS version usable for CMU MIIS Seminar course</h3>

<p>The MIIS seminar course (capstone project planning for M.S. in Intelligent
Information Systems) will include a project on “automatically building
customized search engines with LAPPS”. In this project, students will setup
their crawlers, indexers, and searchers as LAPPS services. For a new domain, the
crawler will fetch relevant documents to construct a domain-specific corpus,
then send to the indexer. The index searchers can be part of information
retrieval pipeline with testing queries and gold standards as inputs. Students
will experiment with different ways of document discovery, query formulation,
and ranking methods. By comparing retrieved documents with gold standards, they
can then evaluate the effectiveness of newly built search engines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out what services are needed <span class="green">Di and Eric</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lapps-version-usable-for-cmu-question-answering-course">LAPPS version usable for CMU Question Answering course</h3>

<p>The LAPPS Grid will be used to support the development of a world history
question-answering pipeline. Students will incorporate exiting LAPPS annotators
(e.g. Time annotators) to their system. When students develops a “heavy”
component and wants other team members to use it, they can deploy it as a LAPPS
service. For example, a Wikibook corpus searcher or DBPedia spotlight (knowledge
entity recognizer) is not usually able to run on a laptop. We will make the
LAPPS Grid more attractive to students by including major LDC-held resources
like Gigaword corpus available in the grid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out what services are needed <span class="green">Di and Eric</span></li>
  <li>Provide documentation on wrapping services</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lapps-version-usable-for-brandeis-computational-linguistics-course">LAPPS version usable for Brandeis Computational Linguistics course</h3>

<p>The Fundamentals in Computational Linguistics (COSI 114) class is offered in
Spring 2014. The Language Grid will be deployed as the development, testing, and
evaluation platform for three class projects. The LAPPS Grid needs to be ready
for this class by March 2015. A staggered roll-out, with elements needed for
project 2 and 3 available somewhat later, is acceptable.</p>

<p>The first project is on part of speech tagging. Students create their own Python
POS tagger using the Viterbi algorithm and evaluate it using the LAPPS
Grid. Prefered data would be Tweets, but it is okay to use data available on the
LAPPS Grid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore whether and how Twitter data can be used on the LAPPS Grid</li>
  <li>If Twitter data are used:
    <ol>
      <li>implement a service that accesses Twitter data</li>
      <li>generate a gold standard over Twitter data</li>
      <li>adapt the composer/evaluator so it can work with Twitter data</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If Twitter data are not used:
    <ol>
      <li>select a gold standard for pos tags</li>
      <li>confirm whether the current composer/evaluator meets the needs</li>
      <li>updates to evaluation code where needed</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Streamline the process of wrapping Python services. Ideally, this would be a
push-button operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second project is on lexical semantics and distributional word similarity,
where student are asked to analyze a corpus. Here the LAPPS Grid is used to
provide access to data as well as statistical measures over those data (a kind
of mini-SketchEngine). Some of the requested statistics: Mutual Information,
Jackard Measure, Cosine, Singular Value Decomposition, Latent Semantic Indexing,
log-likelyhood ratio, basic frequency counts, t-test, chi-square test.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design how the LAPPS Grid deals with the various statistical measures over data</li>
  <li>Adapt existing statistical packages and wrap them, or</li>
  <li>Implement and wrap these measures</li>
</ul>

<p>The third project is on Machine translation, using IBM model 1 and the EM
algorithm. Students are given translated texts, create a bilingual dictionary
and implement a model. The LAPPS Grid provides data and an evaluation
module. This project also depends on the smooth Python wrapping needed for
project 1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select bilingual data and wrap them as Data Sources</li>
  <li>Adapt the composer/evaluator so it can deal with evaluation of translations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implement-licensing-model">Implement licensing model</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Run Tomcat over HTTPS. <span class="green">Assigned to everyone</span>.
    <ol>
      <li>Services <strong>must</strong> be reregistered with the Service Manager so the new, secure
  ports are used instead of the unsecured ports.</li>
      <li>Close unsecured ports so Tomcat <strong>only</strong> accepts secure connections.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Prototype authentication system with LDC.
    <ol>
      <li>Finalize authorization workflow.</li>
      <li>Finalize JSON format(s).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Common authentication/authorization service (See Security).</li>
  <li>Protect resources at LDC
    <ul>
      <li>Incoming LIF objects must contain appropriate <em>access token</em>. This is basically
  a session cookie included in the JSON.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="request-changes-to-the-service-grid">Request changes to the service grid.</h3>

<p>For now, these are achanges to deal with REST services and changes to support
our licensing issues</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact Yohei with requests <span class="green">Keith</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-items-on-the-roadmap">Other items on the roadmap</h3>

<p>In no particular order. Some may need to be transferred to the above sections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release 2.0.0 for Java modules. <span class="green">Assigned to Vassar</span>.
    <ol>
      <li>Merge feature branches back into develop branches.</li>
      <li>Code review</li>
      <li>Bump version and release.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Wrap some UIMA Services.
    <ul>
      <li>Not assigned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Outstanding Issues
    <ul>
      <li>ID values in views.  Currently ID values are <span class="red">not</span> unique
  in a JSON document. E.g. a token will have the same ID in every view it appears in. How 
  do we say, <em>“I want token x from view y.”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
