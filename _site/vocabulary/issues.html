	<h1>LAPPS Vocabulary - Current Issues</h1>

<p>Last update: November 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014.</p>

<p>There are now four spots where the syntax and semantics of the LAPPS data
structures are defined: the source code (mainly the wrappers),
the <a href="vocab.lappsgr&lt;/dd&gt;id.org">LAPPS Web Services Exchange Vocabulary</a>,
the <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema/lif-schema.json">LAPPS JSON
schema</a> and the
<a href="http://lapps.github.io/interchange/">LAPPS Interchange Format
specifications</a>. None of these are final and all of them have open issues. In
addition, these four sources are not in sync. This page contains open issues for
the LAPPS vocabulary: unclarities, ommisions, and inconsistencies relative to
the LIF specifications (for those cases where the latter are ahead of the
vocabulary).</p>

<dl class="spacy normalfont">


<dt>Required versus optional attributes</dt>

<dd>The vocabulary does not make a distinction between required and optional
  attributes. We do not yet have a clear idea what attributes should be
  required. Take for example the <em>Annotation</em> element. We should probably
  require the <em>id</em> attribute. But we cannot require <em>start</em>
  and <em>end</em> since under <em>Annotation</em> we may have things
  like <em>Dependency</em>, for which character offsets are not meaningful.</dd>


<dt>Lists versus sets</dt>

<dd>When the vocabulary says "List of URIs", does this imply that the list is
ordered? Shall we use List and Ordered List, or List and Set?</dd>


<dt>Adding vocabulary pages for coreference </dt>

<dd>
See the <a href="http://lapps.github.io/interchange/coref-v3.html">Coreference in
LIF</a> page. We need to add two elements.

<p><table>

<tr>
  <td>Coreference</td>
  <td>
  Stores all information on coreference. It has two features:
  <ul>
    <li><em>mentions</em>. A list of identifiers. Each identifier points at an
    object of type <em>Annoation</em> or a subtype thereof.
    <li><em>representative</em>. An identifier that points to the full form of
    the elements in the coreference chain, that is, one of the elements of
    the <em>menrions</em> list.
  
  An alternative here is to not use the identifiers but the objects
  themselves. using the identifiers seems the better choice, it lines up better
  with the representation in LIF.


<tr>
  <td>Markable</td>
  <td>
  This is needed in LIF in case we do not have annotation objects that the
  mentions list can point to. An object then needs to be created from the
  offsets alone and we called this a <em>Markable</em> object. It has an extra
  feature named <em>targets</em> that allows it to point to other annotation
  objects. It may also need features like ENTITY_MENTION_TYPE in order to store
  what is available in the output of typical coreference services.</td>
</tr>

<!--
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
-->

<p><strong>Note</strong>. The <em>Markable</em> element may be used for other,
  non-coreference, purposes as well. How do we deal with this when it comes to
  features from a wide variety of views? One answer would be to stipulate
  that <em>Markable</em> elements are only used for creference and that similar
  elements for other purposes need other names.</p>


<dt>Adding vocabulary pages for phrase structure</dt>

<dd>
See
the <a href="http://lapps.github.io/interchange/phrase_structure-v1.html">Phrase
structure in LIF</a> page. We need to add two elements.

<p><table>

<tr>
  <td>PhraseStructure</td>
  <td>
  The container with all phrase structure information. Possibly an immediate subtype
  of <em>Annotation</em>. It has two features:
  <ul>
    <li><em>categorySet</em>. A meta data feature containing a URI for a
    particular category set. If defined in the LAPPS vocabulary, this URI would
    be inside http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/types.<br /> Question: should this be a
    list of URIs?
    <li><em>constituents</em>. A set of annotation objects of type <em>Constituent</em>.
  


<tr>
  <td>Constituent</td>
  <td>
  The list of constituents defines the tree structure of the parse tree. Each
  constituent has two features.
  <ul>
  <li><em>label</em>. A category label, defined in the URI that is
  the value of <em>PhraseStructure#categorySet</em>.
  <li><em>children</em>. An ordered list of identifiers. Each identifier points
  to an annotation object of type <em>Constituent</em>.
