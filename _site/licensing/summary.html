	<h1>Licensing Meeting Summary</h1>

<p>The following items were discussed (in no particular order):</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>JSON Formats</strong>

<ul>
<li>While defining a precise JSON format was beyond the scope of our 
meeting, we did discuss how licensing constraints might be expressed in the LAPPS formats.</li>
<li>Existing software for generating and consuming LAPPS Interchange Format (LEDS).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong>

<ul>
<li>This is going to be hard, and to be done properly requires modifications to the
service grid software.  An ad-hoc interim solution will be required in the short term.</li>
<li>How can LAPPS services use the existing
infrastructure already in use at the LDC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Licensing Calculus</strong>

<ul>
<li>We need one. More specifically, we need an authorization 
calculus. If we want to reason about licensing then we need some formal rules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Workflow</strong>

<ul>
<li>What will a typical conversation between the user, resource provider, and services
look like.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Many questions still need to be answered before we can implement the licensing model:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are we to distinguish between transformative uses and derivative uses?

<ul>
<li>Does this mean services will be required to state if they create transformative or derivative 
works?</li>
<li>Do any LDC resources prohibit derivative or transformative uses?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How much information about users is LDC willing to share with the grid?

<ul>
<li>During authentication is the LDC willing to return a list of a user&#39;s permissions and access
rights? Or should the LDC simply return a yes/no response to an authorization request.</li>
<li>Should the composer collect the username/password and send those to the LDC,
or should the composer redirect to a LDC hosted form that returns an access token?

<ul>
<li>Having the composer collect the username/password is less secure.</li>
<li>Having the composer collect the username/password is less work for the LDC.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <em>Fee</em> constraint; is that a fee the user must pay to use the resource, or does
it grant the user the right to sell the pipeline output?</li>
<li>Do we need to distinguish between <em>user</em> types and <em>usage</em> types, eg. can a <em>commerical</em>
user (ie. a company) use a resource for <em>research</em> purposes?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Possible Technologies</h3>

<p>None of the security standards we discussed will be able to assist us until the Service
Grid software supports them natively.  For OAuth or WS-Security to work the service needs
low level access to the HTTP request (OAuth) or to the SOAP-Envelope (WS-Security). That
can only be done by the service grid.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<ol>
<li>User logs in to composer/planner</li>
<li>User selects a (LDC) data source 

<ul>
<li>Authorized at LDC</li>
<li>LDC returns access token, user permissions, and resource permissions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User creates a pipeline.</li>
<li>Composer/planner validates pipeline

<ul>
<li>Get metadata from services.</li>
<li>Check permissions.  If insufficient rights then:

<ol>
<li>Display list of problems to the user.</li>
<li>Go back to step #3.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Displays licensing agreement user must agree to.

<ul>
<li>Is a simple click through sufficient?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run pipeline.

<ul>
<li>Add licensing metadata to the output.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<ol>
<li>Get everything running on HTTPS</li>
<li>Calculus for Licensing permissions.

<ul>
<li>Some constraints can not be enforced at runtime and only need to be displayed to the user 
so they can agree (or not) to the conditions.</li>
<li>Some permissions must be enforced, e.g. users must specify their intended use.</li>
<li>Some permissions are <em>permitted</em>, e.g. redistribution.  Just because a resource
allows redistribution does not mean users <em>must</em> redistribute their results. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>JSON licensing data returned by LDC

<ul>
<li>What dimensions are required.</li>
<li>What metadata is added by services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User authorization

<ul>
<li>Login using current LDC authentication system.</li>
<li>Service Grid modified to consume OAuth services.</li>
<li>LDC to implement OAuth authentication services.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Developer Guidelines</h2>

<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t ask the user anything until we have to.</li>
</ol>
