<h1>Tokens and Tags in LIF</h1>

<p>Last updated: October 29<sup>th</sup>, 2015</p>


<p>This section contains examples on how to represent tokenized and split
text. It includes how to represent token-level information, in particular part
of speech tags.</p>

<p>Sentence splitters create annotation objects of type Sentence and tokenizers
create objects of type Token, these are both defined in the LAPPS vocabulary
at <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Sentence.html">
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Sentence.html</a>
and <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token.html">
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token.html</a>. POS taggers fill in
the <code>pos</code> property in the <code>features</code> dictionary on the
Token (but note that some taggers create Token objects as part of that
process). There are many pipelines for creating sentences, tokens and part of
speech tags. As an example, we take a pipeline where the OpenNLP splitter as
wrapped at Brandeis is followed by the Vassar Stanford tokenizer and the Vassar
Stanford POS tagger (we assume here that the Stanford tokenizer and tagger are
wrapped as separate services).</p>

<p>The example LIF object handed into the pipeline is as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld",
  "text": { "@value": "Fido barks." },
  "views": []
}
</pre>

<p>With this object as input, the sentence splitter will append a Sentence view
to the views array and the tokenizer a Token view. Recall from the LIF overview
that wrapped components are expected to add views to the end of the views array
and to give each view a unique identifier.</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld",
  "text": { "@value": "Fido barks." },
  "views": [
    {
      "id": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Sentence": {
            "producer": "edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Splitter:0.0.4",
            "type": "splitter:opennlp" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Sentence", "id": "s0", "start": 0, "end": 11 } ]
    },
    {
      "id": "v2",
      "metadata": {
         "contains": {
           "Token": {
             "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
             "type": "tokenization:stanford" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11 } ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>The Stanford tagger, the third step in the pipeline, could do one of two
things: add part-of-speech information to the existing Token view or add a new
view. In the first case, the view with the identifier "v2" will be amended to
look as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "id": "v2",
  "metadata": {
     "contains": {
       "Token": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
         "type": "tokenization:stanford" },
       "Token#pos": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATagger:1.4.0",
         "posTagSet": "penn",
         "type": "postagging:stanford" }}},
  "annotations": [
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4, "features": { "pos": "NNP" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10, "features": { "pos": "VBZ" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11, "features": { "pos": "." } } ]
}
</pre>

<p>Information is added both to the meta data and to the annotations list.  In
the vocabulary, <code>posTagSet</code> is defined as a meta data property on
Token and <code>producer</code> and <code>rules</code> are meta data properties
inherited from Annotation. Note the use of <code>Token#pos</code>
and <code>pos</code>. These are two alternative ways of pointing to the same URL
in the vocabulary and this works if the context contains the following
lines:</p>

<pre class="example">
"@vocab": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/",
"token": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token#",
"pos": "token:pos",
</pre>

<p>The first line allows <code>Token#pos</code> to be expanded to
"http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token#pos" and the second and third line do the same
for <code>pos</code>. We could have used <code>Token#pos</code> in the features
dictionary but we prefer the shorter version.</p>

<p>We have discussed not allowing a service to add information to an existing
view. While this introduces some redundancy (a POS service cannot just add a
feature anymore and would have to create an new view and copy information into
it), it would create a clear picture where a view, once added, can never be
changed. And if a view would say on what other view it is based with the
<code>dependsOn</code> metdadat attribute, then we could derive a flow chart of what views
were used in the processing chain. We have decided to allow additions.</p>

<p>The second way for the tagger to add to the LIF object is to add a view and
not change the existing Token view. While the views with identifier "v1" and
"v2" would remain the same, the next view would be appended to the views
list:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "id": "v3",
  "metadata": {
     "contains": {
       "Token#pos": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATagger:1.4.0",
         "posTagSet": "penn",
         "type": "postagging:stanford" }}},
  "annotations": [
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4, "features": { "pos": "NNP" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10, "features": { "pos": "VBZ" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11, "features": { "pos": "." } } ]
}
</pre>

<pre class="example">
{
  "id": "v3",
  "metadata": {
     "contains": {
       "Token": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
         "type": "tokenization:stanford" },
       "Token#pos": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATagger:1.4.0",
         "posTagSet": "penn",
         "type": "postagging:stanford" }}},
  "annotations": [
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4, "features": { "pos": "NNP" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10, "features": { "pos": "VBZ" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11, "features": { "pos": "." } } ]
}
</pre>
-->

<p>The view's annotation list is identical to the previous one shown because
meta data elements from "v2" are copied and the tagger does not overwrite
existing information. There are other cases though where existing information
could be overwritten (for example a cascade of taggers where later taggers are
allowed to overwrite results of earlier taggers). In those cases, adding a view
with merged information has the benefit of not removing information.</p>

<p class="issue">At this point, there is no established way in the meta data to
specify that this view is based on views "v2", if we adopt
the <code>dependsOn</code>attribute then we would be able to do that.</p>

<p class="issue">In the above, we have used types like "splitter:nlp",
"tokenization:stanford" and "postagging:stanford". These refer to URLs in the
types section of the vocabulary. An initial type system for these is under
construction.</p>
