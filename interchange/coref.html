    <p>This document contains examples on how to represent
    coreference in the LAPPS Interchange Format. It also has
    examples of the output of some common coreference tools.</p>

    <h2>Some Linguistics</h2>
    <p>Coreference occurs when two or more text elements have the
    same referent, that is, they refer to the same person or thing.
    One of these text elements is a full form. There are several
    kinds of coreference:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <i>Joe Doe hurt himself</i>. The anophor 
      <i>himself</i> refers to the same thing as the full form 
      <i>himself</i>. In this case the full form is called the
      antecedent.</li>
      <li>
      <i>Despite her reluctance, Jane Doe understood the issue</i>.
      The cataphor 
      <i>her</i> occurs before the postcedent (the full form).</li>
      <li>
      <i>Carol told Bob to attend the party. They arrived
      together</i>. The anaphor 
      <i>they</i> has a split antecedent.</li>
      <li>
      <i>The man refuses to help. The jerk thinks he is too good
      for that</i>. Coreferring noun phrases, where the second noun
      phrase is a predication over the first.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Much of this is taken from 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference"

    <h2>Coreference output examples</h2>
    <p>The 
    <b>Stanford tools</b> create a list of mentions for each
    coreference chain and assigns the "representative" attribute to
    one of the elements. Each mention refers to sentence and token
    identifiers. For the text 
    <i>"John is sick. He is home. Jill sees her dog."</i>, we have
    the following output:</p>
    <pre class="example">
&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;document&gt;
    &lt;sentences&gt;
      &lt;sentence id="1"&gt;
        &lt;tokens&gt;
          &lt;token
id="1"&gt;&lt;word&gt;John&lt;/word&gt;...&lt;/token&gt;
          ...
        &lt;/tokens&gt;
        &lt;parse&gt;(ROOT (S (NP (NNP John)) (VP (VBZ is) (ADJP
(JJ sick))) (. .))) &lt;/parse&gt;
        &lt;dependencies
type="basic-dependencies"&gt;...&lt;/dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependencies
type="collapsed-dependencies"&gt;...&lt;/dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependencies
type="collapsed-ccprocessed-dependencies"&gt;...&lt;/dependencies&gt;
      &lt;/sentence&gt;
      &lt;sentence id="2"&gt;...&lt;/sentence&gt;
      &lt;sentence id="3"&gt;...&lt;/sentence&gt;
    &lt;/sentences&gt;
    &lt;coreference&gt;
      &lt;coreference&gt;
        &lt;mention representative="true"&gt;
         
&lt;sentence&gt;1&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;start&gt;1&lt;/start&gt;&lt;end&gt;2&lt;/end&gt;&lt;head&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;&lt;text&gt;John&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/mention&gt;
        &lt;mention&gt;
         
&lt;sentence&gt;2&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;start&gt;1&lt;/start&gt;&lt;end&gt;2&lt;/end&gt;&lt;head&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;&lt;text&gt;He&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/mention&gt;
      &lt;/coreference&gt;
      &lt;coreference&gt;
        &lt;mention representative="true"&gt;
         
&lt;sentence&gt;3&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;start&gt;1&lt;/start&gt;&lt;end&gt;2&lt;/end&gt;&lt;head&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;&lt;text&gt;Jill&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/mention&gt;
        &lt;mention&gt;
         
&lt;sentence&gt;3&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;start&gt;3&lt;/start&gt;&lt;end&gt;4&lt;/end&gt;&lt;head&gt;3&lt;/head&gt;&lt;text&gt;her&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/mention&gt;
      &lt;/coreference&gt;
    &lt;/coreference&gt;
  &lt;/document&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
</pre>
    <p>Here is some output from the 
    <b>OpenNLP coreference</b>:</p>
    <pre class="example">
OpenNLP Coreference 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input sentences 1 ::
Carol told Bob to attend the party. They arrived together.

Sentence#1 parse after POS &amp; NER tag:
(TOP (S (NP (NNP Carol)) (VP (VBD told) (NP (NNP Bob)) (S (VP (TO
to) (VP (VB attend) (NP (DT the) (NN party))))))(. .)))

Sentence#2 parse after POS &amp; NER tag:
(TOP (S (NP (PRP They)) (VP (VBD arrived) (ADVP (RB together)))(.
.)))

Now displaying all discourse entities::
        Mention set:: [ Bob  :: They  ]
        Mention set:: [ the party  ]
        Mention set:: [ Carol  ]
</pre>
    <p>Here too, we have sets of mentions. From this print it is
    not possible to see how internally mentions in the data
    structure refer to text elements, whether it is by pointing to
    sentence and token identifiers, as with the Stanford tool, or
    to nodes in the parse tree. This example, by the way, shows
    that split antecedents are not dealt with by OpenNLP (at least,
    not in this case).</p>
    <p>And here is the 
    <b>ANNIE coreference</b> output from GATE. This is the
    coreference component as wrapped at Vassar (
    <a href="http://grid.anc.org:8080/service_manager/wsdl/anc:gate.coref_1.3.5">http://grid.anc.org:8080/service_manager/wsdl/anc:gate.coref_1.3.5</a>.
    The className and itemClassName attributes were removed to make
    the datas tructure easier to read.</p>
    <pre class="example">
&lt;Annotation Id="28" Type="Person" StartNode="9" EndNode="13"&gt;
&lt;Feature&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;matches&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Value&gt;28;31&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/Feature&gt;
&lt;Feature&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;string&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Value&gt;John&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/Feature&gt;
&lt;/Annotation&gt;
&lt;Annotation Id="31" Type="Person" StartNode="27"
EndNode="30"&gt;
&lt;Feature&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;ENTITY_MENTION_TYPE&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Value&gt;PRONOUN&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/Feature&gt;
&lt;Feature&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;antecedent_offset&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Value&gt;9&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/Feature&gt;
&lt;Feature&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;matches&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Value&gt;28;31&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/Feature&gt;
&lt;/Annotation&gt;
</pre>
    <p>This is a fragment of the result for 
    <i>There is John Smith. I saw him in London</i>. This
    particular result was obtained from a pipeline where the
    coreference occurred after named entity recognition. Without
    NER, there are no coreference results (this may be a feature of
    the particular coreference coponent wrapped). The NER found 
    <i>John</i> and 
    <i>him</i> as persons, but not 
    <i>Smith</i>. Coreference information is added to the Person
    annotations. StartNode and EndNode refer to the character
    offsets, whereas matches refers to the annotation object
    identifiers.

    <h2>Coreference in the LAPPS Interchange Format</h2>
    <p>Time for some coreference representations in JSON. The
    examples below are all for the simple phrase 
    <i>Sue sees herself</i>. The JSON is fairly informal, just
    showing the bits and pieces that are relevant to the
    discussion.</p>
    <p>The LIF approach to coreference is closer to the Stanford
    and OpenNLP output than to the GATE output, that is, we express
    corefence as an attribute or set of attributes on Token or
    Person objects. Instead, we introduce Coreference and Markable
    annotation categories, defined in the vocabulary at 
    <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Coreference.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Coreference.html</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Markable.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Markable.html</a>.
    The latter category is a common appearance in coreference
    annotation.</p>
    <p>There are several ways in which coreference can be
    represented. Here is an example where the coreference view
    refers to elements in another view and where in fact the
    tokenization in that view may have been input to the
    coreference tool.</p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "text": "Sue sees herself",
  "views": [ 
    { "id": "v1",
       "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Token": {
            "producer":
"edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Tokenizer:n.n.n",
            "type": "tokenizer:opennlp" }}},
      "annotations": [ 
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 4, "end": 8 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 9, "end": 16 }
]},
    { "id": "v2",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Markable": {
            "producer":
"edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.xxxx.coref:n.n.n" },
          "Coreference": {
            "producer":
"edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.xxxx.coref:n.n.n" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m0", "targets": [ "v1:tok0"
] },
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m1", "targets": [ "v1:tok2"
] },
         { "@type": "Coreference", 
           "id": "coref0", 
           "features": {
             "mentions": [ "m0", "m1" ],
             "representative": "m0" }}]}]
}
</pre>
    <p>The Coreference element contains a list of mentions, which
    are identifiers of annotation objects in the same view. In this
    case the mentions refer to markables that refer to eleents in
    another view. Markables either have start and end attributes or
    the target attribute. These attibutes are inherited from Span
    (see 
    <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Span.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Span.html</a>).
    Note that this use of Span is a bit peculiar since we allow
    spans to either have a start and end or have a list of targets
    which each have a start and end, th eformer use is common, but
    the latter use may raise eyebrows.</p>
    <p>Here is an example where there is no other view to refer to
    and where the markables directly refer to text offsets.</p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "text": "Sue sees herself",
  "views": [ 
    { "id": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Markable": { },
          "Coreference": { } }},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m0", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m1", "start": 9, "end": 16
},
         { "@type": "Coreference", 
           "id": "coref0",
           "features": {
             "mentions": [ "m0", "m1" ],
             "representative": "m0" }}]}]
}
</pre>
    <p>If a coreference component generates actual annotations that
    can be used, but that are not available in other views, then we
    put them in the coreference view. Below we have Token
    annotations in the coreference view. Instead of Token we could
    also have Person or NounChunk or any other Annotation type.</p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "text": "Sue sees herself",
  "views": [ 
    { "id": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Token": { },
          "Markable": { },
          "Coreference": { } }},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 9, "end": 16 },
         { "@type": "Markable",
           "id": "m0",
           "features": {
             "targets": [ "tok0" ] }},
         { "@type": "Markable",
           "id": "m1",
           "features": {
             "targets": [ "tok2" ] }},
         { "@type": "Coreference", 
           "id": "coref0",
           "features": {
             "mentions": [ "m0", "m1" ],
             "representative": "m0" }}]}]
}
</pre>
    <p>Sometimes, coreference modules will have all kinds of other
    information on the annotations that are linked. For example,
    the ANNIE Coreference componen has an attribute
    ENTITY_MENTION_TYPE with value PRONOUN on one of the
    annotations. We put them in the features directory of the
    Markable.</p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "text": "Sue sees herself",
  "views": [ 
    { "id": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Token": { },
          "Markable": { },
          "Coreference": { } }},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 9, "end": 16 },
         { "@type": "Markable",
           "id": "m0",
           "features": {
             "targets": [ "tok0" ] }},
         { "@type": "Markable",
           "id": "m1",
           "features": {
             "targets": [ "tok2" ],
             "ENTITY_MENTION_TYPE": "PRONOUN" } },
         { "@type": "Coreference", 
           "id": "coref0", 
           "features": {
             "mentions": [ "m0", "m1" ],
             "representative": "m0" }}]}]
}
</pre>
    <p>The list of targets can be used to deal with split
    antecedents. For example, in "John and Mary left, they were
    late", the mentions can be m1 and m2, and m1 is a Markable with
    "John" and "Mary" as targets. Note though that in this case we
    need to be able to refer to annotation objects that contain
    "John" and "Mary". If they are not available then we need to
    introduce markables that refer to other markables.</p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "text": "John and Mary left, they were late",
  "views": [ 
    { "id": "v1",
      "metadata": { },
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m0", "start": 0, "end": 4 },
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m1", "start": 9, "end": 13
},
         { "@type": "Markable",
           "id": "m2",
           "features": {
             "targets": [ "mo", "m1" ] }},
         { "@type": "Markable", "id": "m3", "start": 20, "end": 24
},
         { "@type": "Coreference", 
           "id": "coref0", 
           "features": {
             "mentions": [ "m2", "m3" ],
             "representative": "m2" }}]}]
}
</pre>
    <p>Markables m0 and m1 could be other annotation types like
    Token or Person.</p>
