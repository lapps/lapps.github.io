<h1>Overview of LIF</h1>

<p>Version 1, October 2014</p>

<p>This document contains a general overview of the LAPPS Interchange Format
(LIF), which is a JSON-LD format used to tranport data between LAPPS
services. This version of the document is just a draft with a couple of
disjointed notes.</p>

<p>The current JSON schema for LIF are at</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema/lif-schema.json">
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema/lif-schema.json</a>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point it is dangerous to assume that the schema are in sync with the
prose in these LIF pages.</p>

<p>The rest of this document now has some current open issues and questions.</p>

<dl class="nicer">

<dt>Use of identifiers in LIF.</dt>

<dd>This is tricky from a conceptual angle (I think). We now have a situation
  where two views (from the tokenizer and tagger for example) can have Token
  objects with the same identifier. Is this confusing? I find it somehwat
  confusing to have two different JSON objects with the same identifier (they
  are different because the same Token in the tagger view has added
  attributes). Are these identifiers really references to some underlying object
  that we imply, but that does not occur in the representation explicitly? And
  do we need the identifiers for the Token objects with the same text span to be
  the same? We don't really because the Token objects also have the start and
  end offsets which are identical for the two. The identical identifiers do
  indicate that the two tokens in the two views really are the same token, if we
  require each token identifier to be unique to the document, then we loose
  this. We can make it work either way, the issue may just be to decide on what
  is easier to explain to outsiders.</dd>

<dt>Is the list value of view ordered or unordered</dt>

<dd>We could require that any view added by a lif-wrapped service has to be
  appended to the end and that is the list were ordered we could read a
  processing history from the views list. If we want to do that we would have
  to change the value of "views" and make it look like

	<blockquote>
	"views": { "@list": [ ... ] }
	</blockquote>

  Alternatively, this can be done in the context:

	<blockquote>
	"@context": { "views": { "@container": "@list" } }
	</blockquote>

  My current preference is to make the order not matter in the views list since
  this is the least effort and make the fewest assumptions.</dd>


<dt>Does a view know who created it?</dt>

<dd>Yes in the sense that it has a set of producers, one or more for each
  annotation type. But the producer is not an identifier of any kind, rather, it
  is some string that give us an indication of where it came from (and we now
  tend to use the Java class). The producer cannot be the webservice that
  created the view because the web service does not know where it lives. We also
  do not know explicitly what was the producer that added new data to the
  view. Note that a view can have data that were copied from other views. We can
  probably derive a flow in convoluted ways, but I think it is better to
  consider a view as a purely descriptive device, one that contains no
  procedural knowledge. If we want to do the latter, only the composer can do
  that.</dd>


<dt>Does a view know what kind of data it contains, what kind of data were
  added by the service and what data were used by the service?</dt>

<dd>Yes, no and no. It knows what data it contains in the "contains" attribute
  in the meta data. The question on what was added and what was used is much
  harder to answer. We could require that the service that added the view has
  to give it some information about itself, perhaps by dumping all its metadata
  in the view in a "service" attribute of the meta data. This will probably only
  make sense if each view is added by only one service.</dd>


<dt>What is the "type" attribute doing?</dt>

<dd>This is the attribute that is bundled with the producer names inside the
  "contains" attribute of the view metadata. I have no idea what it means and I
  suggest we remove it.</dd>


<dt>How many views can be created by a service?</dt>

<dd>Do we restrict this to exactly one view or do we allow a service to add
  many views. We may also allow a service to add no views and instead add data
  to existing views. If we have a one-view-added-per-service we can give the
  view some metadata on the service that created it.</dd>


<dt></dt>

<dd></dd>


</dl>

<p>There is a general issue that surfaces when thinking about the metdata and
  the views. One thing that motivated the old "steps" attribute was to be able
  to find data that some service may need. Another was (I think) that isolating
  the results of a service in one view may be neat. But it may make for a muddy
  story of what our views really are.</p>
