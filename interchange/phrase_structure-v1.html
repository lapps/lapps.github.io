<h1>Phrase Structure in LIF</h2>

<p>Version 1, October 2014</p>

<p>We introduce an Annotation object with @type PhraseStructure. This object
contains a single parse tree for some text span, typically for a sentence. It
introduces a feature named constituents which contains a list of annotations of
@type Constituent. A Constituent has a label reflecting the category and in the
feature dictionary a list of children.</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "text": "Sue sees herself",
  "views": [
    { "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Token": {
            "producer": "edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Tokenizer:n.n.n",
            "type": "tokenizer:opennlp" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 3 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 4, "end": 8 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 9, "end": 16 } ]},
    { "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "PhraseStructure": {

           "features": {
              "constituents": [
                 { "@type": "Consituent",
                   "label": "S",
                   "id": "c0",
                   "features": {
                     "children": [ "c1", "c2"] } },
                 { "@type": "Consituent",
                   "label": "NP",
                   "id": "c1",
                   "features": {
                     "children": [ "tok0" ] }},
                 { "@type": "Consituent",
                   "label": "VP",
                   "id": "c2",
                   "features": {
                     "children": [ "tok1", "tok2" ] }}]}}]}]
}
</pre>


<p>Some notes and open issues on the above:</p>

<ol class="spacy">

<li>Similar to the coreference structure, should the children be local
identifiers? In the example above, two of the consituents refer to tokens in
another view. For coreference, we stipulated that only Markable objects can
refer to objects in other views. Do we have a same stipulation here? Using
Markable objects seems wrong here.

<li>In addition to the PhraseStrcuture object this view could also have Token
objects in it.

<li>Identifiers of constituents are here all in the format "cN", we do allow
any other that complies to the required syntax for expressions, for example, we
allow "s0", "np0" and "vp0" as identifiers.

<li>We decided not to represent the tree structure directly using deeper
embedding. This is part of a more general issue which is whether we LIF
structures are structurally as close as possible to encoded data structures like
trees, linked lists and graphs. Sine we cannot do graphs that way anyway, we
decided to flatten out all these structures, but embed them in their own
annotation type (PhraseStructure in this case).
