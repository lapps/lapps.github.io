<h1>Phrase Structure in LIF</h1>

<p>Last updated: October 29<sup>th</sup>, 2015</p>


<p>We use two annnotation object from the vocabulary, PhraseStructure and Consituent:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/PhraseStructure.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/PhraseStructure.html</a>
<li><a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Constituent.html">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Constituent.html</a>
</ul>

<p>The PhraseStrucutre object contains a single parse tree for some text span,
typically for a sentence. It introduces a feature named constituents which
contains a list of identifiers referring to (1) annotations of @type Constituent
in the same view or (2) annotations of @type Token that may live in another
view. A Constituent has a label reflecting the category and in the features
dictionary a list of children.</p>

<!--
<p>Some notes and open issues on the above:</p>

<ol class="spacy">

<li>Similar to the coreference structure, should the children be local
identifiers? In the example above, two of the consituents refer to tokens in
another view. For coreference, we stipulated that only Markable objects can
refer to objects in other views. Do we have a same stipulation here? Using
Markable objects seems wrong here. 

<li>In addition to the PhraseStructure object this view could also have Token
objects in it.

<li>Identifiers of constituents are here all in the format "cN", we do allow
any other that complies to the required syntax for expressions, for example, we
allow "s0", "np0" and "vp0" as identifiers.

<li>We decided not to represent the tree structure directly using deeper
embedding. This is part of a more general issue which is whether we LIF
structures are structurally as close as possible to encoded data structures like
trees, linked lists and graphs. Sine we cannot do graphs that way anyway, we
decided to flatten out all these structures, but embed them in their own
annotation type (PhraseStructure in this case).
