<h1>Tokens and tags in LIF</h1>

<p>Version 1, November 20<sup>th</sup>, 2014.</p>


<p>This section contains examples on how to represent tokenized and split
text. It includes how to represent some token-level information, including part
of speech.</p>

<p>Sentence splitters create annotation objects of type Sentence and tokenizers
create objects of type Token, these are both defined in the LAPPS vocabulary
at <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Sentence.html">
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Sentence.html</a>
and <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token.html">
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token.html</a>. POS taggers fill in
the <code>posTag</code> property in the <code>features</code> dictionary on the
Token (but note that some taggers create Token objects as part of that process).</p>

<p>There are many pipelines for creating sentences, tokens and pos tags and
lemmas. As an example, we take a pipeline where the OpenNLP splitter as wrapped
at Brandeis is followed by the Vassar Stanford tokenizer and the Vassar Stanford
POS tagger (note that we assume here that Stanford tokenizer and tagger are
wrapped as separate services).</p>

<p>The LIF object handed into the pipeline is as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld",
  "text": { "@value": "Fido barks." },
  "views": []
}
</pre>

<p>With this object as input, the first component of the pipeline will append a
Sentence view to the views array and the tokenizer a Token view. Recall from the
LIF overview that wrapped components are expected to add views to the end of the
views array and to give each view a unique identifier.</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld",
  "text": { "@value": "Fido barks." },
  "views": [
    {
      "id": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Sentence": {
            "producer": "edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Splitter:0.0.4",
            "type": "splitter:opennlp" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Sentence", "id": "s0", "start": 0, "end": 11 } ]
    },
    {
      "id": "v2",
      "metadata": {
         "contains": {
           "Token": {
             "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
             "type": "tokenization:stanford" }}},
      "annotations": [
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10 },
         { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11 } ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>The Stanford tagger, the third step in the pipeline, could do one of two
things: add part-of-speech information to an existing view or add a new view. In
the first case, the view with the identifier "v2" will be amended to look as
follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "id": "v2",
  "metadata": {
     "contains": {
       "Token": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
         "type": "tokenization:stanford" },
       "Token#pos": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATagger:1.4.0",
         "posTagset": "penn",	
         "type": "postagging:stanford" }}},
  "annotations": [
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4, "features": { "pos": "NNP" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10, "features": { "pos": "VBZ" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11, "features": { "pos": "." } } ]
}
</pre>

In the vocabulary, <code>posTagset</code> is defined as a meta data property on <code>Token</code> (and
<code>producer</code> and <code>rules</code> are defined as meta data properties
of <code>Annotation</code>). Note also the use of <code>Token#pos</code>
and <code>pos</code>. These are two alternative ways of pointing to the same URL
in the vocabulary, given that the external context file has the following three
lines:

<pre class="example">
"@vocab": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/",
"token": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token#",
"pos": "token:pos",
</pre>

<p>The second way for the tagger to add to the LIF object is to add a view and
not change an exiting view. WHile the views with identifier "v1" and "v2" would
remain the same, the next view woul be appended to the views list:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "id": "v3",
  "metadata": {
     "contains": {
       "Token": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATokenizer:1.4.0",
         "type": "tokenization:stanford" },
       "Token#pos": {
         "producer": "org.anc.lapps.stanford.SATagger:1.4.0",
         "posTagset": "penn",	
         "type": "postagging:stanford" }}},
  "annotations": [
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok0", "start": 0, "end": 4, "features": { "pos": "NNP" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok1", "start": 5, "end": 10, "features": { "pos": "VBZ" } },
     { "@type": "Token", "id": "tok2", "start": 10, "end": 11, "features": { "pos": "." } } ]
}
</pre>

<p>This views list is identical to the previous one shown because meta data
elements from "v2" are copied and tagging example does not overwrite existing
information. There are other cases though where existing information could be
overwritten (for example a cascade of taggers where later taggers are allowed to
overwrite results of earlier taggers). In those cases, adding a view with merged
information has the benifit of not removing information.</p>

<p class="issue">There are references to <code>tokenization:stanford</code>
and <code>postagging:stanford</code>. These both refer to URLs in the types
section of the vocabulary. We need to come up with an initial directory
structure for these.</p>
