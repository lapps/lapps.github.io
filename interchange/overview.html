<h1>Overview of LIF</h1>

<p>Last updated: May 26<sup>th</sup>, 2016</p>


<h2>The structure of LIF objects</h2>

<p>A LIF object contains the text, a list of annotation views, a reference to an
external context file and optional metadata. The top-level structure of a LIF
object is as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld",
  "metadata": { },
  "text": { },
  "views": [ ]
}
</pre>

<p>There are four top-level
keys: <code>@context</code>, <code>metadata</code>, <code>text</code>
and <code>views</code>. The following sub sections will describe the values of
these four keys.</p>


<h3>The @context key</h2>

<p>The value here is the fixed URL
<a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld</a>
which leads to a document with a JSON object that points to various parts of the
LAPPS vocabulary. We allow people to provide their own context, but we do not
allow services to changes this top-level context and turn it into a
list. Instead, we allow services to add contexts to individual views or to add
elements to contexts in individual views. However, we strongly caution against
redefining terms that are defined in the external context or the vocabulary
since then some annotation objects or properties would have different meanings
depending on what view they are in. Note that this sentiment is shared by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#advanced-context-usage">JSON-LD
recommendation</a>: <i>this is rarely a good authoring practice and is typically
used when working with legacy applications that depend on a specific structure
of the JSON object</i>.</p>


<h3>The metadata key</h3>

<p>All examples of output of our services have an empty object here. There is no
current use case for what could be in this metadata object. The LIF object is
created and consumed by wrappers and metadata information added should be
relevant to and usable by these wrappers. All metadata we have so far are
relevant to individual views only and are included in the views
key. Nevertheless, we will allow a metadata key here for future use.</p>


<h3>The text key</h3>

<p>This is a JSON <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-value-object">value
object</a> containing a <code>@value</code> and a <code>@language</code>
key. The value associated with
<code>@value</code> is a string and the value associated
with <code>@language</code> follows the rules in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#bib-BCP47">BCP47</a>, which for our
current purposes boils down to using the ISO 639 code (also see
the <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Document.html#language">Document
section</a> in the vocabulary).


<h3>The views key</h3>

<p>This is where all the annotations and associated information live. The value
is a JSON array of views where each view specifies what information it contains
and what service created that information. Views are similar to annotation
layers and annotation tasks as used by several annotation tools, formalisms and
frameworks. They contain structured information about a text but are separate
from that text. They also provide flexibility in structuring annotations.</p>

<p>First a note on the nature of the views array. JSON-LD arrays are by default
unordered lists, but we decided to make this an ordered list. The order is
interpreted to reflect when views were added. So we require that any view added
by a service that generates LIF has to be appended to the end.</p>

<p>There are a few general principles:</p>

<ol class="spacy">

<li>There is no limit to the number of views.

<li>Each view has a unique identifier. Annotation elements in the view have
identifiers unique to the view and these elements can be uniquely referred to
from outside the view by using the view identifier and the annotation element
identifier.

<li>The view's metadata specify what kind of information objects are in the
view.

<li>Services may create as many new views as they want.

<li>Services may add information to existing views, both to the metadata section
and the annotations. We have considered making views read only, which has some
advantages, see the <a href="tokens.html">Tokens and Tags</a> section for a
discussion.

<li>Services may not overwrite or delete information in existing views. This
holds for the view's metadata as well as the annotations.

</ol>

<!--
<p>It may be a good idea to not allow a service to add information to an
existing view. While this introduces some redundancy (a POS service would need
to copy data from aToken view for example), it would create a clear picture
where a view, once added, can never be changed. And if a view would say on what
other view it is based, then we could derive a flow chart of what views were
used in the processing chain.</p>
-->

<p>Here is a minimal example of a view with just one annotation element. </p>

<pre class="example">
"views": [ 
   {
      "@context": {},
      "id": "v0",
      "metadata": {
        "contains": {
          "Token": {
            "producer": "edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Tokenizer:0.0.4",
            "type": "tokenization:opennlp",
            "rules": "tokenization:opennlp_basic"
          }
        }
      },
      "annotations": [ 
         { "@type": "Token", 
           "id": "t0", 
           "start": 0, 
           "end": 5, 
           "features": {} 
         }
      ]
   }
]
</pre>

<p>There are four keys in the view
object: <code>@context</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>metadata</code> and
<code>annotations</code>.</p>

<p>The <b>@context</b> key is an optional key used for user-defined context
elements. As noted before, this is one of two possible choices on how to do
this. One of the general principles listed above was that services may add
information to existing views. Typically this would involve adding a feature to
the Annotation element dictionary or adding an Annotation element. </p>

<p>The question is what we do when the newly added feature or annotation element
is not defined in our vocabulary or is interpreted differently by the
service. To deal with the first case the service can simply add the needed term
to the local context, as illustrated in the view fragment below.</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "@context": { "MyToken": "http:/www/example.com/MyToken" },
  "annotations": [ 
    { "@type": "MyToken", "id": "t0", "start": 0, "end": 5 } ]
}
</pre>

<p>The second case is more complicated. Say the service creates Token elements but
these elements have an idiosyncratic interpretation which cannot be explained
away by using the <code>type</code> or <code>rules</code> keys (see below). And,
more importantly (and a more likely scenario), say the service adds Token
elements to a view that already has Token elements. Adding a Token definition to
the context in the existing view now overwrites the existing interpretation of
Token, which is not acceptable. There are two solutions: (i) do not allow a
service to redefine a term that was not added by the service, and (ii) do not
allow services to change the context of an existing view. The latter is preferred
because the former is much harder to do and to enforce. Note also that if you
have two kinds of Tokens in a view it is impossible to say who was the
producer. With the latter approach, services that want to use their own context
definitions either have to create a new view for adding that context or use a
fully expanded URI.</p>

<p class="issue">This needs to be vetted and agreed on.</p>

<p>The <b>id</b> key is required and its value should be unique relative to all
view objects. If annotation elements refer to an Annotation in another view then
they have to use the view identifier as part of the reference.</p>

<p>The <b>metadata</b> key contains information to describe the annotations in a
view. At this point, its only key
is <code>contains</code>. The <code>contains</code> dictionary has keys that
refer to annotation objects in the LAPPS vocabulary or properties of those
annotation objects (they can also refer to user-defined objects or
properties). And the value of each of those keys is a JSON object
with <code>producer</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>rules</code> keys. The
relevant part of the example above is repeated here:</p>

<pre class="example">
{
  "contains": {
    "Token": {
      "producer": "edu.brandeis.cs.lappsgrid.opennlp.Tokenizer:0.0.4",
      "type": "tokenization:opennlp",
      "rules": "tokenization:opennlp_basic" }}
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>producer</code> key contains a string that specifies what service
created the annotation data. Unfortunately, this string cannot be the unique
name that the LAPPS grid has for this service, nor can it be the URL where the
service resides. The reason for this is that the service itself has no access to
this information and it is the service (actually, the service wrapper) that adds
information to the LIF objects. The current convention is to use the java class
name of the service and the producer name is actually added to the LIF object by
accessing a name or identifier method on the server.</p>

<p class="issue">We have discussed adding (1) a <code>timestamp</code> key,
probably using Unix epoch, and (2) a <code>dependsOn</code> key which could be
used to specify what views a view depends on.</p>

<!--
<p class="issue">Thinking this through again I still feel somewhat uneasy about
this. We cannot guarantee any kind of uniqueness of this name and this brings up
the specter that this value may be misleading or useless. Three potential
solutions. One is to make the value a URI, but as Keith pointed out this may
raise the expectation that said URI is an actual page and adds the soft
requirement to put up that page. Another is to make sure the service knows who
it is by changing the execute method and add an optional extra argument with the
URI or unique name of the service. We can do this because the composer or the
lsd/groovy script that composes services does have access to the unique name
(for example, the composer has access to the end point URL). The last solution
is to not care that this value is not an identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is whether there a clear use case for this feature.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to leave this unresolved for now.</p>
-->

<p>The <code>type</code> key is used to specify what kind of token we are
dealing with. It allows several tokenizers to specify the same type, for example
if two tokenizers are both implementations of the OpenNLP tokenization
scheme. In the example here the type key has the compact IRI value
"tokenization:opennlp", where tokenization refers to the tokenization key in the
external context file
in <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld">http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/context-1.0.0.jsonld</a>,
which contains the following two lines:

<pre class="example">
    "types": "http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/types/",
    "tokenization": "types:tokenization/",
</pre>

<p>Because of these definitions, <code>tokenization:opennlp</code> will be expanded to
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/types/tokenization/opennlp. The <code>rules</code>
key inside of Token can be used to specify a rule set, in this case one defined by 
http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/types/tokenization/opennlp_basic.</p>

<p>Finally, the value of <b>annotations</b> is a list of annotation objects. The
relevant part of the view printed above is repeated here: </p>

<pre class="example">
"annotations": [
  { "@type": "Token",
    "id": "t0",
    "start": 0,
    "end": 5,
    "features": {}
  }
</pre>

<p>The keys allowed are specified in the 
<a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema/lif-schema.json">JSON LIF schema</a>
in the definitions for <code>annotations</code> and <code>annotation</code>. The
value of <code>@type</code> is an element of the LAPPS vocabulary or an
annotation category added by the user. If a user-defined category is used then
it would be defined outside of the LAPPS vocabulary and in that case the user
should either use the full URI or add a context to the view in which this new
annotation category lives.</p>

<p>Identifiers are unique to the view. It is allowed that two views both have an
annotation with the same identifier and these could even be annotations of the
same type (Token for example) and have the same start and end character
offset. To uniquely refer to one of them we use the view identifier and the
annotation identifier separated by a colon and the Token in the example above
can be referred to as "v0:t0".</p>

<p>Technically all that is required of the keys in the features dictionary is
that they expand to a URI. In most cases, the keys reflect properties in the
LAPPS vocabulary and we prefer to use the same name. So if we have a property
"pos", we will use "pos" in the dictionary. This implies that "pos" needs to be
defined in the context so that it can be expanded to the correct URI in the
vocabulary. Note that we need to be careful with properties that are defined on
more than one annotation category. Say, for the sake of argument, that we have
"pos" as a property on both the Token and NamedEntity annotation types. We then
can use "pos" as the abbreviation of only one of the full URI and if we expand
"pos" to http://vocab.lapps.grid.org/Token#pos then we need either use
"NamedEntity#pos" or come up with a new abbreviated term. So far this situation
has not presented itself.</p>

<p>All annotation elements in a view are direct members of the list of
annotations, that is, annotations are not embedded inside of other
annotation. For example, Constituent annotations will not contain other
Constituent objects. However, in the features dictionary annotations can refer
to other annotations using their identifiers.</p>

<p>The rest of the LIF specifications consists of examples of some common
annotation categories in
the <a href="http://vocab.lappsgrid.org">vocabulary</a>, showing how the
annotation types translate into LIF structures.</p>
