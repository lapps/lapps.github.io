<p>This document describes how to install the service grid software from scratch on a Mac
running OSX 10.6.8.</p>


<a name="sources"></a>
<h2>Downloading Sources</h2>


<p>In the directory where this html file lives (and, more importantly, the
installation script), create a new directory named <code>sources</code>, then subdirectories
<code>langrid</code>, <code>postgres</code> and <code>tomcat</code>. To install
a service grid, we need Tomcat, PostgreSQL and the Service Grid code.</p>

    also need the Apache Commons DBCP and the Apache Commons Pool to make tomcat
    ready for the service grid. Get commons-dbcp-1.4-bin.tar.gz from

<h2>Setting up a PostgreSQL Database</h2>

<p>Installation is a fairly simple process, even though it is not immediately
clear what happens behind the screens, I do not quite remember how I figured out
what to do and the postgres documentation is at first glance not very
helpful. There are two steps.</p>

<ol>

<li> Create /etc/sysctl.conf with the following content

<pre class="code">
kern.sysv.shmmax=1610612736
kern.sysv.shmall=393216
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=32
kern.sysv.shmseg=8
kern.maxprocperuid=512
kern.maxproc=2048
</pre>

<p>The main goal here is to increase shared memory. After this, you need
to reboot the system so the settings above take effect.</p>

<li> Double click the installer and use all defaults, the only thing that really
needs to be entered is the password of the postgres user. PostgreSQL will be
listening on the default port 5432. PostgreSQL libraries are installed
in <code>/Library/PostgreSQL/9.3</code> (which also has the psql command line
tool in the bin directory).

</ol>

<p>The installation includes pgAdmin III and the application stack builder,
which can be used to add some extensions. With pgAdmin, creating a database for
the service manager is a five-step procedure:</p>

<ol>

<li>
Open pgAdmin3 in <code>/Applications/PostgreSQL 9.3</code> and select the
PostgreSQL 9.3 Server in the Object Browser, then right-click it and select
"Connect" in order to see and connect to your databases.
<!-- Not sure if this means anything beyond pgAdmin since the service
grid Service Manager seems to work fine. NOTE: figure out how to start and stop
the DB (using pgAdmin to connect will start it I think).-->

<!--
<li>
Press top left button ('Add a connection to a server') to create a new server if you want
one.  Give it a name (test) and use password 'wortel' (which is the postgresql password,
this password is not a password that you define for the server) and use all defaults. This
step does not appear to be needed.
-->

<li>
Select "Login Roles" and right-click it. Select "New Loging Role...". Add a role
(eg 'service'), give it a password under the Definition tab (eg
'servicepw'). Right-click the login role and select "properties" to change the
password.



<blockquote>
<img src="images/postgres-login-role.jpg" width="800pt"/>
</blockquote>

<li>
Now select "Databases" and right-click it. Select "New Database...". Give it a
name (eg 'servicegrid') and an owner ('service').

<li>
Select the newly created database and click the SQL button in the top
menu. Paste in the contents of
<code>source/langrid/langrid-corenode-p2p-2.0.0-20120718/postgresql/create_storedproc.sql</code>
(or its <a href="examples/create_storedproc.sql" target="_blank">local copy</a>
in this manual). You can use the "Open File" button for this (second on the left
on the menu bar). Then click "Execute query" (the green right arrow on the menu
bar). You should get a message indicating success as below.

<blockquote>
<img src="images/postgres-stored-procedure.jpg" width="800pt"/>
</blockquote>


<li>
Select the function that was just created ("servicegrid > Schemas > public > Functions")
and double click the owner in the properties tab (a dialog appears, click OK, then a new
dialog appears which has the habit of disappearing behind the main window). Now change the
owner from postgres to service.

</ol>

<p>A few remarks on the above:</p>

<ol>

<li>All this can also be done with the <code>installdb.sh</code> script
in <code>sources/langrid/langrid-corenode-p2p-2.0.0-20120718/postgresql</code>. This
script creates the login role and the database, executes "createlang plpgsql $1"
and alters a function by changing the owner. Creating the plpqsql language is
not needed for PostgreSQL 9, the others were all done in the steps above.</li>

<!--
<li>In installdb.sh, the funtion that is altered is AccessState.increment, but this
function does not exist since create_storedproc.sql creates a function named
AccessStat.increment. This seems to be a versioning glitch since version 20101210 had
AccessState and 20120525 has AccessStat. The install script was not updated
accordingly. This point is moot with the later version that we are using.</li>
-->

<li>The actual database tables are installed later, when the service manager
code in the Tomcat instance is first executed.</li>

</ol>

<p>You can now close pgAdmin and install the service manager.</p>


<a name="service"></a>
<h2>Installing the Service Manager</h2>

<p>We will now create a new Tomcat server that runs the Service Manager code
in <code>tomcat-sm</code>. We do this from scratch, assuming all sources are in
the <code>sources</code> directory as specified in the section on downloading
sources. The new server will use the servicegrid database owned by the service
login role. <!--The original procedure involved manually copying source files
and editing an XML file with many settings. The <code>install-manager.sh</code>
script automates all steps except for editing the settings.--> There are two
steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>Create a file with all settings. There are a couple of pre-baked settings
available in <code>settings-service-manager-lh.txt</code> and
<code>settings-service-manager-ip.txt</code>, where the first one creates a
service manager that can be accessed through the URL http://localhost:8080 and
the second one an identical service manager except that it can be accessed by an
IP address, both access the same database. An annotated example of a settings
file is in <a href="examples/settings-service-manager.txt"
target="_blank">examples/settings-service-manager.txt</a><p/>

</li>

<li>

<p>Run <code>install.py</code>, which takes two required arguments: the settings
file and the target directory. This script makes some assumptions about the
structure of the sources directory so it is important that the downloading
instructions were followed to the letter.</p>

<pre class="code">
% python install.py settings-service-manager-lh.txt tomcat-sm
</pre>

<p>This adds a Tomcat user named 'tomcat' with password 'tomcatpw' to the tomcat
users file. This user can manage the applications. You can define another
username and password by invoking <code>install.py</code> with two extra
arguments:</p>

<pre class="code">
% python install.py settings-service-manager-lh.txt tomcat-sm USER PASSWORD
</pre>

</li>

</ol>

<p>The install script also starts the Tomcat instance. You can manually start up
and shut down the Tomcat instance like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
% tomcat-sm/bin/startup.sh 
% tomcat-sm/bin/shutdown.sh 
</pre>

<p>With Tomcat running, and assuming you ran the install script exactly as
printed above, you can access the Tomcat server on port 8080 at
<a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a>. The
Service Manager is available at <a href="http://localhost:8080/service_manager"
target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/service_manager</a>. The first time you
open Tomcat or the Service Manager it may take a while because Tomcat is
creating the Service Manager application in
<code>webapps/service_manager</code>, using the Service Manager's .war file. If
you get an error message "Requested resource not available", then you probably
have a problem with PostgreSQL, you can confirm this in the logs directory of
the server. The problem usually is that the database name or password does not
match or that you forgot to start PostgreSQL.</p>



<h2>Installing the Service Manager &mdash; Details</h2>

<p>The installations is done and it is safe to stop reading now. This section
gives the details on what is ging on behind the screens when installing the
service manager. These are older notes and at points refer to Active BPEL, which
used to be installed in tandem with the service manager.</p>

<ol>


<li>

<p>First you install Tomcat and add a few libraries that the service manager
needs. Installation is a matter of unpacking the tar.gz file and putting it somewhere. See
RUNNING.txt in the Tomcat distribution for more details. 

<pre class="code">
% cp -R sources/tomcat/apache-tomcat-6.0.35 tomcat-sm
% cp sources/commons-dbcp-1.4.jar tomcat-sm/lib/commons-dbcp-1.4.jar
% cp sources/commons-pool-1.6.jar tomcat-sm/lib/commons-pool-1.6.jar
% cp sources/postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar tomcat-sm/lib/postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar
</pre>

<p>I am assuming here that all the downloaded sources live in "sources" and that the
tomcat archive was expanded. Note also that the script assumes some structure inside the
sources directory.</p>

<p>One thing this script does in this step is calling a Python script that adds a tomcat user to
<code>tomcat-base/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code> and allows this user to run the Tomcat
Manager. By default, this user is "tomcat" and has the password "tomcat". You may want to
change the password in <code>scripts/adjust_tomcat_users1.py</code>.</p>

Note that the default install is
for port 8080 and that you have to do some stuff to make it otherwise (which is what you
do at some point when installing bpel). To install tomcat on another port, you will have
to look at conf/server.xml in the tomcat home directory, where you have to change the
Connector for the HTTP protocol.</p>

<p>To start and shut down tomcat do this:</p>

<pre class="code">
% tomcat-sm/bin/startup.sh 
% tomcat-sm/bin/shutdown.sh 
</pre>

<p>After startup, you can access the tomcat server at <a href="http://localhost:8080"
target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a> (or use an IP address if you have one). When
doing a process listing with Tomcat running, you should see a tomcat process which will
look like this:

<pre>
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home/bin/java
   -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-servicegrid/conf/logging.properties
   -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager
   -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-servicegrid/endorsed
   -classpath /Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-servicegrid/bin/bootstrap.jar
   -Dcatalina.base=/Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-sm
   -Dcatalina.home=/Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-sm
   -Djava.io.tmpdir=/Users/marc/Sites/tomcat-sm/temp
   org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
</pre>



</li>

<li>
<p>Copy the service_manager.xml configuration file:</p>

<pre class="code">
% mkdir tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina
% mkdir tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina/localhost
% setenv LANGRID_SOURCE sources/langrid/langrid-corenode-p2p-2.0.0-20120718
% cp
   $LANGRID_SOURCE/tomcat-langrid/conf/Catalina/localhost/langrid-2.0.xml
   tomcat-sm/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml
</pre>

<p>The setenv command is used for display purposes (without it, the path to
langrid-2.0.xml does not fit on one line) and the last command is not quite correct since
line breaks were added for display reasons. The first two steps are not needed if you had
at some point started the tomcat server. If you had started it, it is best to shut it down
before you do all this.</p>

<li>
Edit <code>tomcat-sm/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml</code> to insert the relevant
settings. See <a href="examples/service_manager.xml"
target="_blank">examples/service_manager.xml</a> for an example. While this can be done
manually, this is a tad tedious and error prone since you will have to redo everything
every time you do this and everything means editing about 20 spots in
service_manager.xml. Instead, edit a settings file in this directory (for example
<code>settings-service-manager.txt</code>) and run a python script to insert the settings
into the xml file.

<pre class="code">
% mv tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml
     tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml.org
% python scripts/create_service_manager_xml.py 
     settings-service-manager.txt 
     tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml.org
     tomcat-sm/conf/Catalina/localhost/service_manager.xml
</pre>

There are a couple of pre-baked settings files available (settings-service-manager-lh.txt
and settings-service-manager-ip.txt), where the first one creates a service manager that
can be accessed through the URL http://localhost:8080 and the second one an identical
service manager except that it can be accessed by an IP address, both access the same
database. An annotated example of a settings file is
in <a href="examples/settings-service-manager.txt"
target="_blank">examples/settings-service-manager.txt</a><p/>

<li>
Copy the service manager war file to the Tomcat webapps directry:

<pre class="code">
% cp sources/langrid/jp.go.nict.langrid.webapps.langrid-core-20120718-2.war
     tomcat-sm/webapps/service_manager.war
</pre>

(By the way, if new code is released and you want to update your Service Manager, all you
need to do is to stop Tomcat, remove <code>tomcat-sm/webapps/service_manager</code> and
<code>tomcat-sm/webapps/service_manager.war</code>, redo the step above, and restart
Tomcat. This preserves all settings in the configuration file.)

</ol>

<p>In step 3 above, I refered to the XML settings file
named <code>service_manager.xml</code> and an associated text
file <code>settings-service-manager.py</code>. By editing the latter and using the Python
script to insert the settings you avoid some annoying bookkeeping on the XML file. The
parameters that need to be set occur in both files. Basically, the text file defines
substitutions for the xml file. Below is a line from each file to illustrate this.</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
  <td>service_manager.xml
  <td>&lt;Parameter name="langrid.node.url" value="${NODE_URL}"/>

<tr>
  <td>settings-service-manager.txt
  <td>${NODE_URL} &nbsp;&nbsp;  http://localhost:8080/service_manager

</table>
</blockquote>

The parameters that are relevant for hooking up the Service Manager with Active BPEL, with
variable names and actual values used, are printed below:

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
  <td>langrid.node.name
  <td>${NODE_URL}  	
  <td>http://localhost:8080/service_manager

<tr>
  <td>appAuth.simpleApp.authKey
  <td>${AE_TO_CORE_APPAUTHKEY}	
  <td>ccbbaa 	    

<tr>
  <td>langrid.activeBpelServicesUrl
  <td>${CORE_TO_AE_BASEURL}  	      	
  <td>http://localhost:8081/active-bpel/services

<tr>
  <td>langrid.activeBpelAppAuthKey
  <td>${CORE_TO_AE_APPAUTHKEY}	
  <td>aabbcc

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two parameters encode how the Service Manager is going to be known to the
Active BPEL instances and the second two are how the Active BPEL instance will be known to
the Service Manager. Note that in an earlier version of the software (20101210),
${CORE_TO_AE_BASEURL} and ${CORE_TO_AE_APPAUTHKEY} were named ${INVOKER_TO_AE_BASEURL} and
${INVOKER_TO_AE_APPAUTHKEY} respectively. Also note that in the service_manager.xml file
that is created in step 2, there are two lines with the parameter
langrid.activeBpelServicesUrl. The second one, with value
"http://${AE_TOMCAT_ADDRESS}/active-bpel/services", was removed in step 3 by the Python
script.</p>
