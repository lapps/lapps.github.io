# Topics

## Licensing

Issues discussed:

1. Implementing the licensing model(s) proposed by the LDC will be relatively easy.
1. The major hurdle is that user authentication and authorization is handled by the Service Grid.
1. To achieve the level of control we require necessitates code changes to the Service Grid
software.
1. We cannot rely on changes to the ServiceGrid software and will have to find an ad-hoc
solution.
	* WS-Security, WS-Federation<br/>These are Oasis standards but do not seem to have much 
	traction.
	* OAuth<br/>
	While not discussed at the meeting, [oauth](http://oauth.net) looks promising.
		
Given our time constraints we did not bring Jonathan in on a Skype call. Marc will
Skype in when Jonathan visits Vassar.

## Naming Things

### URI

All URI should use the base URI http://vocab.lappsgrid.org

* Annotation types will use the base URI; e.g. http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token
* Other URI to be used:
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema : location of JSON schema files.
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns : base URI for things that belong in the 
	Lappsgrid namespace but are not part of the annotation vocabulary.
		
### Content-type Discriminators

These should be replaced with URI:

* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/text
* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/text#tab-separated
* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/text#space-separated
* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml
* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/media/xml#gate
* etc.

### Versioning

URI should not include version numbers.  **Note** this is just for URI used in the 
vocabulary.  URLs for services will likely contain version numbers.

We reserve the right to change this practice and introduce URIs with version numbers
in them.  However, no other projects seem to include version numbers in URIs.

### URI for things with a URI

For consistency, all URI used in the LAPPS vocabulary should use http://vocab.lappsgrid.org
as the base URI.

Options that were considered:

1. Use separate subdomains for major distinctions:
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/...
	* http://schema.lappsgrid.org/...
	* http://ns.lappsgrid.org/...
1. Use a single subdomain and use path segments for major distictions:
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/schema/lif-schema.json
	* http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/ns/license#apache-2.0
	
While option #2 allows a greater possibility for naming conflicts, for example if we later 
need an annotations named *schema* or *ns*, it was the preferred option.


## Coreference

[Proposal so far](interchange/coref-v3.html)

1. Always require a *Markable* annotation.
1. *start* and *end* features are not required on *Markable* annotations.
1. *Markable*s may contains *features* and *metadata*

## The Service Grid

We need to contact Yohei/Toru regarding changes to the Service Grid to meet our
requirements.

1. Enforcing licensing contraints
1. Using third party authentication services (i.e. LDC)
1. Native support to register REST services.

## Roadmap

1. Release stable(-ish) versions of LAPPS modules.
1. Start running the Service Manager and LAPPS services on https://
